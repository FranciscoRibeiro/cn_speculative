Speculative Computation

The project's goal is to recommend movies based on information about them.
When it can't obtain those informations right away, it speculates the values and proceeds with a recommendation (process reduction).
The requested info will eventually arrive (fact arrival) and the decision will be reviewed based on the new values.
